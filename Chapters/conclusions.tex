I [ejenstam] kommer de fram till att local search fungerar dåligt.\cite{ejenstam_2014} [yuan 2013] menar de att Large neighborhood Search (LNS) tillsammans med Hybrid Harmony Search (HHS) fungerar mycket väl med flexible job shop problem och löser problemet med begränsningen för CP vid dessa problem.\cite{yuan_2013} Kan vara värt att titta vidare på

As mentioned before, our model assumes there are as many sets of all the tools defined as there are machines, so that each machine has its own set of tools. This simulates an ideal world where we have all the resources we want, when in fact we might be limited to a few sets of tools. To be able to do more realistic schedulings that considers the amount of tools available, there would need to be a considerate number of constraints added to the model and it might be worth looking into in future work.
